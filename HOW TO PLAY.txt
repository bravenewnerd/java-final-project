HOW TO PLAY
download zip and unzip somewhere. make sure there aren't any spaces in the unzipped file name
open command prompt/powershell/bash
type java -version
if you get an error or your java version is hella old (should be 22.x.x dated this year):
    go to https://www.java.com/en/download/ and download the newest version of java
if your java version is up to date:
    in your command line type cd (the path to your unzipped files) for example mine is D:/java_final_project
    now type javac *.java and hit enter. Your command line should pause for a second and then output an empty line.
    now type java Main and press enter
    You should be good to go from there
    press CTRL+C at any time to quit. If you have to do this, please send me the output that you get afterwards.
